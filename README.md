# DOM-Manipulations
here i am trying to show some basic DOM manipulations which contains various buttons like append, prepend ,after, before, empty.
In this program i have added a few animations in my 2nd div block and step-by-step completions of events are notified through console. and at the end of complete animation a alert box will be popped up.
